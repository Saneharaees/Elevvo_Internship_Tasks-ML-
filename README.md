# Elevvo Data Science Internship - Level 2 Tasks

This repository contains the projects completed during my Data Science Internship at **Elevvo**. I have implemented 3 comprehensive Machine Learning tasks, including mandatory requirements and bonus challenges.

##  Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Student Score Prediction (Regression)
* **Goal:** Predict exam scores based on study hours.
* **Model:** Linear Regression & **Polynomial Regression (Bonus)**.
* **Key Highlights:** Data cleaning, visualization, and performance evaluation using R² score and MSE.

### Task 2: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
* **Goal:** Group mall customers based on Annual Income and Spending Score.
* **Algorithms:** K-Means (Optimal K found via Elbow Method) & **DBSCAN (Bonus)**.
* **Key Highlights:** Feature scaling, interactive Streamlit UI, and average spending analysis per cluster.

### Task 3: Forest Cover Type Classification (Classification)
* **Goal:** Multi-class classification to predict forest cover types.
* **Model:** **XGBoost & Random Forest (Bonus)**.
* **Key Highlights:** Handling categorical data, confusion matrix visualization, and feature importance analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Streamlit (for Dashboard/UI)

##  Project Structure
- `Task_1_Regression/`: Notebook and Dataset
- `Task_2_Clustering/`: Streamlit App (`app.py`) and Mall_Customers.csv
- `Task_3_Classification/`: Classification Model and Evaluation
